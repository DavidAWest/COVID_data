A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn't think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn't check her husband's temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband's doctor's office said her husband's temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband's primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn't lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband's primary care doctor wasn't available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor's nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband's doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn't feel any better. Her husband's throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn't tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient's wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband's primary care doctor's office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient's official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued.

This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don't think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.

Please see PA's note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure +/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient's response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.

Culture   Pending            Report Status   Pending              Medical Decision Making:  Patient is an 89-year-old male who presents emergency department for evaluation of shortness of breath and cough.  Differential diagnosis includes, but is not limited to, acute coronary syndrome, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, reaction from recent COVID-19 vaccine, COVID-19 infection, other viral upper respiratory infection, pleural effusion, or CHF. The patient denies any discrete chest pain at this time, though he has had some chest pain with exertion for the past 6 months.  He has had shortness of breath along with his cough, increasing my suspicion for possible infectious process.  Upon his arrival, the patient is known to be tachypneic, with normal oxygen saturation rates.  He is not tachycardic or febrile, therefore does not meet SIRS criteria at this time. Plan at this time to obtain laboratory evaluations, chest x-ray, and EKG.  Low threshold to broaden evaluations to include infectious workup.     Please reference the remaining ED Course for further assessment, plan, and disposition documentation.              ED Course as of Feb 14 1916    Sun Feb 14, 2021    1230   EKG reveals sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute.  QRS duration 100 milliseconds.  QTC slightly prolonged at 460 milliseconds.  There is somewhat concerning peaked T-waves in leads V2 and V3 along with with possible ST elevation in lead V1 this does represent a change from the patient's previous study in November, 2020.    EKG (Hospital)    1315   No leukocytosis.  Hemoglobin and hematocrit within normal limits for the patient.  No thrombocytopenia.  Slight elevation in absolute neutrophil count.   CBC (Complete Blood Count) With Differential(!)    1330   Elevated at 176. As the patient has been having pain for the past 2 days, I am uncertain if this is catching the increase in his troponin, or the downtrend.  He continues to deny chest pain and has reported that his shortness of breath has resolved.   TROPONIN T, HIGH SENSITIVITY(!!)     1419   Electrolytes within normal limits.  Creatinine elevated at 1.41, though this is not significantly elevated in comparison to study obtained approximately 3 weeks ago at 1.2.  Liver function tests within normal limits.  No anion gap.   Comprehensive Metabolic Panel(!)     1420   By my interpretation, multifocal bilateral infiltrates, most consistent with COVID-19.  Also possible right middle lobe infiltrate, concerning for possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia.  This is interesting as the patient did just receive his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.     Plan at this time to broaden infectious work up and order for the patient to receive empiric antibiotics.   XR Chest 1V Portable    1437   Elevated at 2.5.  I will provide the patient with another fluid bolus as his IVC does appear flat upon ultrasound.   Lactic Acid(!)    1503   Continues elevated 233. Will consult cardiology.   TROPONIN T, HIGH SENSITIVITY(!!)     1506   IMPRESSION:     1. Significant and concerning patchy airspace opacities of the right upper, right lower and left mid lung, concerning for a pneumonic process. Less likely, viral upper is for infection, including Covid 19, could be present.     2. No other etiology seen for symptoms     S: 2/14/2021 14:45 CST Electronically Authenticated    D: 2/14/2021 14:42 CST   XR Chest 1V Portable    1506   I did have a discussion with the patient's daughter regarding which she believes her father's code status is.  She agrees that he is likely DNR DNI, but does think that he would like to have the cardiac catheterization completed.  I will confirm this with the patient.      1617   Patient noted to become hypoxic to 76%. Borderline hypotensive at 91/55. No associated tachycardia. Slightly tachypneic at 26 br/min. Oxygen increased to 15 L/min and RT paged for BiPAP.     After a discussion with the patient, he endorses that he understands what DNR/DNI status means, as his wife recently passed away approximately five months ago. He does share that he wishes to be DNR/DNI, which he believes he has paperwork reflecting. I believe at this time that he is of sound mind to make this decision as well, should we not have paperwork available to us reinforce this. He does request that I contact his daughter.      1621   Bedside cardiac ultrasound does not reveal pericardial effusion.  IVC appears flat.  Will order for the patient receive a 2nd 500 cubic centimeters bolus.  RT is present at the bedside Redding to place NIPPV.      1704   D-dimer does age adjust within normal limit.   D-DIMER(!)     1705   Patient with acute primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic acidosis. Continues to be hypoxic on 100% FiO2 with saturation rates at 89%.      At this point in time, I favor the patient's NSTEMI is secondary to demand ischemia given his ongoing hypoxia.  However, given his previous reported history of exertional chest discomfort and dyspnea on exertion, I will at least discuss the patient with another Hospital.   ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS(!)     1805   Patient did have a significant desaturation event that resulted after he disconnected himself from NIPPV.  Upon my arrival into the room, he was noted to be setting 8% with good waveform.  He was cyanotic with agonal respirations.  He was noted to have a pulse that corresponded with the monitor at a tachycardic rate.  He was rapidly placed in a supine position and of bagged with a non-rebreather to increase his oxygen saturation rates.  His oxygen saturation rate did increase, but has not completely recovered.  We did bag him for several minutes and his oxygen level is now in the low 80s.  He is currently on non-rebreather at 15 liters/minute.  He is not following commands.  His daughter is present and I did advise her of this recent update.  I did speak to another Hospital and inform them that the patient would not be transferred at this time.  Patient's blood pressure is noted to be 124/73 mmHg, therefore I will order him some morphine for air hunger.  I did brief the patient's daughter on his current status and we will have her be present in the room with him.      1851   Patient continued to deteriorate, ultimately coughing up bloody secretions. He was suctioned, but continued to be tachypneic and have increased work of breathing. He became bradycardic with heart rates in the 30s. After a discussion with the patient's daughter, the decision was made to silence alarms. Patient was accompanied by his daughter, ultimately noted to lose pulses and time of death was called at 1830, confirmed by loss of palpable pulses and lose of auscultated pulses.      Time was spent discussing the patient with his daughter. We did expedite his PCR COVID swab so as to ultimately know his COVID-19 status.

During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.

I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt's room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her.

Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, ""Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely."" 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus + drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, ""Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn't improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. "" 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: ""This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC>4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient's presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient's chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving."" 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued.

The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (""had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before""). On 24Jan2021, the patient's heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient's wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient's wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped).

On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient's wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient's wife checked, and the patient's blood sugar was 91. The patient's wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; ""which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him."" Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient's wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient's wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient's wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was ""perfect three weeks ago.""

The patient's wife stated that other than his diabetes, ""which he had for (sentence incomplete).""

He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good"" (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient's wife stated, ""I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.""

More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.

A 45-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient had a long history of congenital heart issues. He had been stable and closely monitored for the past 20 years. He had no history of arrhythmia. The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Patient collapsed due to a cardiac arrest on Friday 15Jan2021 and passed away on 19Jan2021. The doctors feel that his cardiac arrest was caused by an arrhythmia. Reporter reported this through the v safe app. And received a message stating reporter would be contacted by the cdc. After patient passed away reporter replied stop to v safe. But still had not been contacted by anyone. This may or may not be related. Reporter have no way of knowing. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender's Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported ""collapsed due to a cardiac arrest"", ""cardiac arrest was caused by an arrhythmia"" and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn't eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient's mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient's father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn't even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient's doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient's temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient's temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient's last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient's follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn't want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient's admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient's temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn't want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient's numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn't do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient's blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient's highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient's blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient's kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn't have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender's Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.
